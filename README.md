This project's meaning to me
=====
- Maybe it would be foolish process developing the operating system only use x86 Intel assembly language.
- Now this project would be result for project which is made by a man who is different, especially thinking about all of things and is crazy about coding.
- This project will be able to give a help on knowledge to other people, who develop for the operating system and system structure.
- I hope that source that i made affectionately can be helped to other people without any restrictive licens limitation. Therefore, I contribute this source to MIT.
